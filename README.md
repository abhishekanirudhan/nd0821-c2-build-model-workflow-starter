# Build an ML Pipeline for Short-Term Rental Prices in NYC

> wandb project: https://wandb.ai/abhishekanirudhan/nyc_airbnb

In this project I look at short-term rental prices from Airbnb for the city of New York. The goal is
to estimate the typical price of similar properties. This is my first time implementing an end-to-end
pipeline on a DevOps framework.
